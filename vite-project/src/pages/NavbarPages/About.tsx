                I'm 16 years old from England. I have been coding professionally for almost a year now and specialise in Minecraft server development as well as Discord Bot creation

                I started coding when I was 13 as a past time because I got bored and slowly found that I was quite good at it. I started learning Python at first and then in 2020 during lockdown I started learning JavaScript to code discord bots. Then slowly progressed into learning Java in 2022 for Minecraft development and have been coding in that primarily ever since!
